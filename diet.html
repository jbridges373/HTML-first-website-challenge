                    <br><h3>What causes low mood?</h3>
                    <p class="par">Most of us can point to one or more reasons to explain a change in our mood. Perhaps we had a poor night’s sleep, our hormones are out of balance, we’ve not been exercising or we miss seeing friends. It could be down to stress, genetics or even our environment. These are all valid explanations, but a growing body of evidence supports another factor – and that's the food we eat.</p></div>
